    Once solutions are generated, you can proceed to the <b>Divergent Thinking Filtering</b> page to visualize, analyze, and select the most relevant options.<br>

## How to Use:

1. **Select requirements**:
   - Select the requirements you wish to take into account for your design problem in addition to those already described in the initial problem.
   - You do not need to choose any if you do not want to.

2. **Generate solutions**:
   - Click on the "Generate New FBS Ontology Data" button to generate LLM solutions to your design problem.
   - Once the solutions have been generated, you will not be able to see them again in this page, but you can access them at any time from the **Filtering** page.

3. **Regenerate solutions**:
   - If the generated solutions do not convince you, you can regenerate new solutions by clicking on the "Reset" button at the bottom of the page.
   - **Note**: If you click on this button, the previously generated information will be lost.
   - Before regenerating solutions, note that in the **Convergent Thinking** page it will be possible to add data manually if you wish to do so.
